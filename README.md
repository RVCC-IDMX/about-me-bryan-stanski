# <span style="font-weight:bold">About Me</span>

Hello there, my name is **Bryan Stanski** and this is my About Me project/Web Site. [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4e89a478-ef46-4d60-b6a5-b4724ea8b852/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/about-me-bryan-stanski/deploys)

## <span style="font-weight:bold">Project Description</span>

The purpose of this project was to apply/practice the concepts that we learned in class to our very own website. These concepts include but are not limited to:
* The use of HTML to create basic webpages with things like objects, nav bars, video and images in the webpage, forms and more
* Utilize css to format/style webpages
* To find and debug code to improve webpages
* Be able to identify and address accessibility issues
* Be aware of Good Design Principles and Responsive programming

Throughout this project, I learned a multitude of skills which you can read about below:

#### <span style="font-weight:bold">Nav Bar Section</span>
While working on the nav bar section, I learned how to create a functional and responsive nav bar in which you will be able to quickly get to any section on the webpage. I also learned how to create a "hamburger menu" for when someone visit my webpage on mobile to make it easier for them to navigate the nav bar. 

#### <span style="font-weight:bold">Profile Section</span>
While I was working on the profile section of my webpage, I learned how to add an avatar/img as well as createa small div for me to put some basic info in like my name and such. While this was not much, it was a good starting point to the project. (By using what I learned from this section in the beginning of the semester, I was about to create and import my own logo to my nav section).

#### <span style="font-weight:bold">Bio Section</span>
While working on the bio section, I was able to refine the skills I learned in the Profile Section and add in a ordered list.

#### <span style="font-weight:bold">Hobbies Section</span>
While working on the hobbies section, I learend how to create an unordered list and how to add links to my webpage (or it could be to anything, but they were specifically for videos).

#### <span style="font-weight:bold">Video Section</span>
While working on the video section, I learned how to create iframes on my webpage and all the different properties I could use. By doing so I was able to further advance my knowledge of css to create a clean and adaptive iframe that would never be too big or drastically moving around the webpage when the screen/webpage size changes.

#### <span style="font-weight:bold">Gallery Section</span>
While working on the gallery section, I learned how to add images into my webpage and how to use a figure to provide descriptions to the images while making it easy to change how the mutliple figures (with their captions) are viewed on my webpage. For example, while the webpage is the size of a desktop/laptop it will show all 3 figures in a row with their captions below the images, but when the webpage is the size of a phone it will show the 3 figures in a single column with the captions below the images again.

#### <span style="font-weight:bold">Lit Section</span>
While working on the lit section, I learned how to create a large section of text and format specific words, letters of all or specific paragraphs using css. By using what I initially learned from this section, I was able to change and adapt it to a blod article about Image Hover Effects.

#### <span style="font-weight:bold">Contact Section</span>
While working on the contact section, I learned how to create a working form that will interact with netlify to gather and store all responses with each input either being a small text box (for names or email addresses), a larger text box (for mutliple sentences) a selection, a selection box (for selecting from a list of options), and a using a unordered list to get a yes or no response (using the input type radio).

## <span style="font-weight:bold">Color Scheme</span>

When applying css to my webpage I had to come up with a color scheme that had enough of a contrast that it would be easily readable (minimum color contrast of 4.5). This color scheme consisted of the main colors:

* <span style="font-weight:bold">#90CCFD or rgb(144,204,253)</span> <img src="Imgs/color_90ccfd.png" alt="Color #90ccfd" style="height:20px;width:20px;border: 2px solid gray;margin-bottom:-5px;margin-top:5px">
* <span style="font-weight:bold">#67AFEB or rgb(103,175,235)</span> <img src="Imgs/color_67afeb.png" alt="Color #67afeb" style="height:20px;width:20px;border: 2px solid gray;margin-bottom:-5px;margin-top:5px">
* <span style="font-weight:bold">#2D363D or rgb(45,54,61)</span> <img src="Imgs/color_2d363d.png" alt="Color #2d363d" style="height:20px;width:20px;border: 2px solid gray;margin-bottom:-5px;margin-top:5px">
* <span style="font-weight:bold">#B38130 or rgb(179,129,48)</span> <img src="Imgs/color_b38130.png" alt="Color #b38130" style="height:20px;width:20px;border: 2px solid gray;margin-bottom:-5px;margin-top:5px">
